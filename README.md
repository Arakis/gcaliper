You need to install the dependencies. Example for Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install mono-complete gtk-sharp3
```
Than:
```
git clone https://github.com/Arakis/gcaliper.git
cd gcaliper
make
```
Launch gcaliper:
```

```
Alternatively install it globally:
```
sudo make install
```
For uninstall:

```

If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
